
If using n8n, include a workflow JSON file (e.g., elevenlabs_automation.json) that:

Triggers on user input (HTTP/webhook).

Runs your AI agent logic.

Calls Eleven Labs API for voice output.

Step 6: Host Your Agent
Deploy your agent on a platform like Render or AWS so it’s accessible via HTTPS (required for live voice interactions). Use webhooks to connect Eleven Labs.

Key Files to Include in Your Repo:
Copy
your-repo/
├── ai_agent/          # Your conversational AI logic
├── elevenlabs_integration.py  
├── demo.py            # Demo script
├── .env.example  
├── README.md          # Setup instructions
└── workflows/         # n8n automation examples (optional)
Important Notes:
Never hardcode API keys—use GitHub Secrets or environment variables.

For full voice conversations, add speech-to-text (e.g., Whisper API) to handle user audio input.
